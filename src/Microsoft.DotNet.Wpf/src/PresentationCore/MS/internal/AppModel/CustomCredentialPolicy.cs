// Description:
//
// This creates and registers a custom ICredentialPolicy that will be used 
// whenever a server sends a 401 UNAUTHORIZED in response to a WebRequest. The 
// .NET framework will call ShouldSendCredential to determine if credentials 
// should be sent. 
//
// Our policy is to go ahead and send whatever credentials there might be, 
// EXCEPT if we are using default credentials and the request is not going to 
// an Intranet, Local Machine or Trusted domain.
//
//!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
// IMPORTANT: We are creating an instance of IInternetSecurityManager here. This
// is currently also done in the AppSecurityManager at the Framework level. Any
// modification to either of these classes--especially concerning MapUrlToZone--
// should be considered for both classes.
//!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
//
// An IInternetSecurityManagerSite is not currently needed here, because the
// only method of IInternetSecurityManager that we are calling is MapUrlToZone,
// and that does not prompt the user.
