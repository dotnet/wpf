# This is a simple wrapper for eng/pipeline.yml to get around the limitation of
# user-defined variables not being available in yaml template expressions.

# Parameters ARE available in template expressions, and parameters can have default values,
# so they can be used to control yaml flow.

variables:

  # clean the local repo on the build agents

# only trigger ci builds for the master and release branches
trigger:
- master
- release/3.0
- arcade

# To be added in the future when VSTS supports this feature
# only trigger pull request builds for the master branch
# pr:
# - master

# Call the pipeline.yml template, which does the real work
