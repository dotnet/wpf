# This is a simple wrapper for eng/ci.yml to get around the limitation of
# user-defined variables not being available in yaml template expressions.

# Parameters ARE available in template expressions, and parameters can have default values,
# so they can be used to control yaml flow.

variables:

  # clean the local repo on the build agents
  Build.Repository.Clean: true

# only trigger ci builds for the master and release branches
trigger:
- master
- release/3.0

# To be added in the future when VSTS supports this feature
# only trigger pull request builds for the master branch
# pr:
# - master

# Call the pipeline.yml template, which does the real work
jobs:
- template: /eng/pipeline.yml
  parameters:
    ${{ if and(ne(variables['System.TeamProject'], 'public'), notin(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')) }}:
