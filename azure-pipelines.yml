# This is a simple wrapper for eng/pipeline.yml to get around the limitation of
# user-defined variables not being available in yaml template expressions.

# Parameters ARE available in template expressions, and parameters can have default values,
# so they can be used to control yaml flow.

# TODO:
#   BuildMsBuildSdkPackages, _BuildMsBuildSdkPackages, _BuildMsBuildSdkPackagesArgs should be removed eventually, when 
#   Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Wpf.Sdk is moved from dnceng/dotnet-wpf-int to github/dotnet/wpf. 
#   When that move happens, there would be no need to suppress the Sdk build by default. Currently, 
#   allowing the Sdk to build every time will result in an infinite loop that triggers a dotnet/wpf built,

variables:

  # clean the local repo on the build agents

trigger:
- master
- release/3.0

# To be added in the future when VSTS supports this feature
# only trigger pull request builds for the master branch
