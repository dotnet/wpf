      We align casing and naming with Win32 API. As such some types have all lower case names, which
      in theory may conflict with new C# keywords in the future. Our types here are internal so end
      users won't be impacted. If some name becomes difficult to adapt to with the @ symbol we can
      cross that bridge when we hit it (if ever).
