# Windows Presentation Framework (WPF)
This repo contains the open-source components of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) that run on top of .NET Core 3. This is based on, but separate from, the version of WPF that is supported in the Windows Desktop .NET Framework.

Currently, only a subset of the full WPF Frameworks is available as open-source; more code will be pushed to the repo over the coming months.

# Using the code
To get started use WPF on .NET Core 3, follow the [Getting Started instructions](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/wpf). The WPF APIs are document on MSDN **Get best URL**.

# How to build the code
Currently, this repo only contains the `System.XAML` assembly and is not sufficient to build a complete version of WPF. 

**Can you do anything useful with it?**

# Contribution guidelines
We are not accepting pull requests to WPF for this Preview release; we will udpate this section with contribution guidelines as we move closer to an initial full release of the code.

If you have a feedback (bug, suggestion, etc.)  *specifically* about WPF on .NET Core 3, please [open a new issue here](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/). If you have more general feedback about .NET Core 3, please use the [dotnet/core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) repo.

# Code of conduct
The WPF repo follows the [.NET Foundation Code of Condut](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct).
