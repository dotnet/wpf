# Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

[![Build Status](https://dnceng.visualstudio.com/public/_apis/build/status/dotnet/wpf/dotnet-wpf%20CI)](https://dnceng.visualstudio.com/public/_build/latest?definitionId=270)

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a UI framework for building Windows desktop applications. WPF supports a broad set of application development features, including an application model, resources, controls, graphics, layout, data binding and documents. WPF uses the Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) to provide a declarative model for application programming.

WPF applications are based on a vector graphics architecture. This enables applications to look great on high DPI monitors, as they can be infinitely scaled. WPF also includes a flexible hosting model, which makes it straightforward to host a video in a button, for example. The visual designer provided in Visual Studio makes it easy to build WPF application, with drag-in-drop and/or direct editing of XAML markup.

See the [WPF Roadmap](roadmap.md) to learn about project priorities, status and ship dates.

[WinForms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms) is another UI framework for building Windows desktop applications that is supported on .NET Core. WPF and WinForms applications only run on Windows. They are part of the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop` SDK. You are recommended to use [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) to use WPF and WinForms with .NET Core.

## Getting started

* [.NET Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)
* [Getting started instructions](Documentation/getting-started.md)
* [Contributing guide](Documentation/contributing.md)
* [Migrating .NET Framework WPF Apps to .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop-wpf/migration/convert-project-from-net-framework)

## Status

- We are currently in planning for .NET 5. 
- We have completed publishing WPF sources. You can learn more about this at https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2554. 
- We have completed porting WPF to .NET Core as part of .NET Core 3.0, you can learn more about what was done [here](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/1936).

See the [WPF roadmap](roadmap.md) to learn about the schedule for specific WPF components.

We have published few tests and have limited coverage for PRs at this time as a result. We will add more tests in 2019 and 2020, however, it will be a progressive process. 

The Visual Studio WPF designer is now available as part of Visual Studio 2019. 

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

Some of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file bugs, join in design conversations, and fix issues.

* This repo defines [contributing guidelines](Documentation/contributing.md) and also follows the more general [.NET Core contributing guide](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/contributing.md).
* If you have a question or have found a bug, [file an issue](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/new).
* Use [daily builds](Documentation/getting-started.md#installation) if you want to contribute and stay up to date with the team.

### .NET Framework issues

Issues with .NET Framework, including WPF, should be filed on [VS developer community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/61/index.html), 
or [Product Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus?ws=support).
They should not be filed on this repo.

## Relationship to .NET Framework

This code base is a fork of the WPF code in the .NET Framework. .NET Core 3.0 was released with a goal of WPF having parity with the .NET Framework version. Over time, the two implementations may diverge.

The [Update on .NET Core 3.0 and .NET Framework 4.8](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/10/04/update-on-net-core-3-0-and-net-framework-4-8/) provides a good description of the forward-looking differences between .NET Core and .NET Framework.

This [update](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) states how going forward .NET Core is the future of .NET. and .NET Framework 4.8 will be the last major version of .NET Framework.
