This folder contains all XPS related XML Schemas (XSDs).

The MASTER schemas are located in schemas\Master.

Schemas used for publication in the XPS specification are located in schemas\Publish. DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY.
Schemas used for valiating loaders are located in schemas\Validation. DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY.


Procedure for editing Schemas:
==============================

1. Go to schemas\Master
2. Check out the schema you want to edit
3. Perform edits
4. Go to generator, run generate
5. Optional: If your schema change is relevant for the XPS documentation, please notify jessmc or oliverfo



Procudure for including Schemas in your code:
=============================================

1. In the assembly where you want to use the schema, add the respective .resources file from the generated folder.

2. Use the following snippet in your code to create a validating XML reader:

        private XmlSchemaSet GetXmlSchemaSet()
        {
            ResourceManager resourceManager = new ResourceManager( "Schemas_S0", Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
            byte [] rdkey = (byte[])resourceManager.GetObject("rdkey.xsd");
            byte [] s0 = (byte[])resourceManager.GetObject("s0schema.xsd");

			XmlSchemaSet xss = new XmlSchemaSet();

			xss.Add(null, new XmlTextReader(new MemoryStream(rdkey)));
			xss.Add(null, new XmlTextReader(new MemoryStream(s0)));
			xss.Compile();

			resourceManager.ReleaseAllResources();
			
			return xss;
        }
