// This class acts as a type of proxy; it is responsible for forwarding all 
// stream requests to the active stream.  Unlike a proxy it is also controls 
// which stream is active. Initially the active stream is the stream provided
// at construction, at the time of the first write operation the active stream
// is replaced with one provided by a delegate.
