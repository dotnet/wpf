   C++ linker is not good at trucking along reousrces from a library all the way to a DLL 
   In order to do this, we have to explicitly include compiled .res files as an input to the linker 
   This target is a helper that to assist with this workaround 
   Incorporate the res files like this: 
   <AdditionalLinkerInputs Include="resource.res" /> 
   When "IncorporateAdditionalLinkerInputs" target runs, it will ensure that all resources mentioned in @(AdditionalLinkerInputs) 
   are included when the final DLL is linked.
