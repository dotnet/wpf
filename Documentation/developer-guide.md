# Developer Guide

The following document describes the setup and workflow that is recommended for working on the WPF project. It assumes that you have read the [contributing doc](contributing-guide.md).

The [Issue Guide](issue-guide.md) describes our approach to using GitHub issues.

## Machine Setup

Follow the [Building CoreFX on Windows](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/building/windows-instructions.md) instructions.

WPF requires the following workloads and  components be selected when installing Visual Studio:

* Required Workloads:
  * .NET Desktop Development
  * Desktop development with C++
* Required Individual Components:
  * C++/CLI support
  * Windows 10 SDK

## Workflow

We use the following workflow for building and testing features and fixes.

You first need to [Fork](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Checking-out-the-code-repository#fork-the-repository) and [Clone](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Checking-out-the-code-repository#clone-the-repository) this WinForms repository. This is a one-time task.
