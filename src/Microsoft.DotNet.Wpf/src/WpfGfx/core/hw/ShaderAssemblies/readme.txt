This directory used to contain the COMPILED shaders from the sources directory and the rc file to embed them into our dll. 

To compile shaders, you needed to install the Windows SDK and add
fxc.exe compiler to your path environment variable. 

To compile the shaders, the compile.cmd batch file is used. 

In the past, adding new embedded shader was done as follows:

   1) Add the source code for the shader to the Sources sub directory.
   2) Modify the compile batch file and add a compile step for your shader. 
   3) Add the source file and compiled shader binary to source depot. 
   4) Edit Shaders.h and add a new global identifier constant for your shader.
   5) Edit the EmbeddedShaders.rc file to register your shader. 
   6) Recompile wpfgfx.dll


Now, the shader binaries are dynamically generated by ..\ShaderAssemblies.targets. ResourceFileTemplate\EmbeddedShaders.RC (which used to be in .\EmbeddedShaders.RC) is copied to $(IntermediateOutputPath)\hw by this targets file during build. This dynamically generated RC file is consumed by the resource compiler during each build.
