  This .targets file is included by RunDrtsLocal.targets, which is built using the Arcade
  extension point AfterSolutionBuild.targets. This doesn't include any of the custom MSBuild properties
  that get set during the regular build. That doesn't matter much to us, there isn't really a whole lot
  of extra stuff we need to do. We only depend on the $(Platform) and $(Configuration) properties to know
  where to include the rest of the tests.
